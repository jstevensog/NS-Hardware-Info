## H2 General Tips For G4 and G5 Battery Swaps

##### H5 Try at your own risk! Below are some experiences of others collated for future reference

* If soldering the top tabs, be very careful about overheating the battery internals.
* A delicate spot welder can be a good method, if you have one.
* There can be slight size differences in battery brands. Both in profile and diameter.
* If you break a top tab try using solder wick. Essentially place the wick onto the shortened tab, apply soldering iron and solder, and the whole thing becomes a contact. Once cooled then just trim it to the desired length and you're back in business.
* Try soldering a broken tab. Scratch back the moulded plastic around the tab so that you have enough metal to solder a bridge accross to the top side of the battery. Be careful not to overheat the battery. Use flux to assist with a quick bond and let it cool between attempts.
* Make the top contact a spring connection by making a little wedge out of a few layers of insulation tape and shove it behind the side of the top contact. That way you don't even need the top part of the contact which can get in the way of the lid.
* On my first battery swap, I had a resistance of about 1200 (compared to < 600 on a second G5 using the very same batteries). pushing on the contacts made no difference to the high resistance . I located the problem to the very thin bit of one of the lower tabs which must have been stressed when I yanked the original welded battery out. The tab was not broken off, but twisting it round slightly like 5° reduced the resistance problem. Twisting another 5° made it shear off
* Make sure the bottom contacts are free of debris. Carefully buff them off of moulded plastic if you have to.
* Try using conductive glue.
