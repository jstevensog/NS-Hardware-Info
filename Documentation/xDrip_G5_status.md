##### H5 These notes are just a record of discussions and experiences from people who have done battery swaps, and some of the xDrip devs. They are not definitive instructions. Use at your own risk.

1. Firmware Version:
* New G5 firmware from Dexcom is 1.0.4.10, released November 2016 in the US. From this version on you need to have `Authenticate G5 before each read` checked in `G5 Debug Settings`.
2. Voltage A & B and Resistance
* Essentially both voltages should be over 300 after a battery swap. Resistance should be as low as possible. Resistance has been observed to increase as batteries deteriorate. High resistance can also indicate a poor battery swap. Lower than 1000 is good, above this and the status goes orange, and then red. Also voltage B starts to drop in relation to A. As it gets further below A you approach depletion. Resistance is probably the most reliable indicator.
